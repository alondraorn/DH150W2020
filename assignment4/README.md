## Introductory Steps

### :white_check_mark: Step 1: Specify the main design challenge

**What is the main activity your project would support the users in accomplishing?**
>This project will support users in being able to pay for parking, as well as find and reserve parking, more easily. This will hopefully serve to make the community of drivers, whether tourists or locals, in Los Angeles happier and more excited to travel to new places.

**What is the basic need involved for that activity?**
>This activity fulfills the user’s basic need for safety because they feel that they are parking in a proper location and they can find out additional information about this location pertaining to safety as well. They feel that they are not having a difficult driving or parking experience.

**What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?**
>Current solutions to satisfy this need for knowing where to park include other applications, which are popular, but from personal observation, do not seem to be very commonly used among my target demographic. For large events or specific venues, there is usually information provided on websites for associated parking. Additionally, people often search for parking in the moment, and they also might look up “parking nearby” when using navigational tools like Google Maps or Apple Maps.

**What is/are the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?**
>Certain limitations for traveling and parking include not knowing availability ahead of time and as a result, spending a lot of time looking for parking or not heading out to a destination at all. Added functionality to the ParkMobile app could definitely help users discover places that they feel comfortable visiting due to positive parking situations and ensure that they become repeat visitors.

### :white_check_mark: Step 2: Identify target users

**What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise)**
>Demographic: people of a legal driving age, own a car, in Los Angeles, likely not tourists, more likely to be current college students or recent grads

>Preferences: users have the desire and ability to drive to places and thus, need a parking solution to assist them

>Expertise: users do not need any particular level of expertise to use this application

**Where would the users do that activity?**
>There are two main activities that can be accomplished using the ParkMobile app — paying for parking on the spot and reserving parking ahead of time at a specific venue. Users would pay for parking on the spot directly in parking lots, while reserving parking ahead of time can be accomplished remotely by users from wherever they choose to do so. The user interviewed in this contextual inquiry participated in both tasks, but with more emphasis on the second one. If users were doing the simple “paying on the spot” activity but without using ParkMobile, they would still be doing this activity in a parking lot, and similarly, could book parking ahead of time from the place of their choosing.

**What would the users do to complete that activity?**
>To pay for parking on the spot, users would either pay a parking attendant, use an automated ticket kiosk, or use a mobile app. To reserve parking in advance, users would likely research the best parking options on the Internet before making an online reservation or calling in.

### :white_check_mark: Step 3: Pick observation method(s)

* The two observation methods I employed include **participatory observation** and **ethnographic research.**
* **Ethnographic research** simply involves observing how people in UCLA Parking Structure 2 seem to be paying for parking. Some of my observations include:
    * Those who pay at the physical pay stations appear to be older people and people who do not park much at UCLA / newcomers who are confused as to how they should pay for parking. Once I have seen a girl sprinting back to her car in order to avoid receiving a ticket for going past the time limit she had paid for. 
    * Many individuals park and walk quickly to and from their cars — these people are likely utilizing the application due to the fact that they are moving quickly and do not stop by the parking ticket machine. They are also not parking in the permit area, but in the “visitor parking” area.
    * There is generally an even split between both kinds of user personas present at UCLA Parking Structure 2. I have also anecdotally heard that some people do not pay for parking in this structure, not only from the desire to avoid spending money, but also because of the often clunky payment process.
    * The ParkMobile application is helpful in places where you have not been before, if you are a regular user of ParkMobile. For example, I was parking at UCSD and the physical signage at the parking lot was quite confusing (spaces marked A, B and V), but the ParkMobile application told me that paying would only be valid for stalls marked with the letter V for visitor. Other individuals who only observed the physical signage did not receive this insight and may have gotten ticketed.
* I conducted **participatory observation research** with a friend who fits my target demographic details. Please find the materials used in the next section.
