## Introduction

ParkMobile is a free mobile application (both iOS and Android) that allows users to find, reserve, and pay for parking from their mobile devices. ParkMobile partners with parking providers like college campuses, event venues, stadiums, and airports to provide easy parking solutions for both direct users of the application and these parking providers themselves. For reference, ParkMobile is the parking system used by UCLA, which I personally began using since the payment machines in the parking garages are often unable to process credit card payments and require exact payment in cash as they do not provide change.
