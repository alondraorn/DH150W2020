# Lost in Los Angeles: How to Find Parking (and Community) with ParkMobile

### _by Tasia Mochernak // Digital Humanities 150 at UCLA, Winter 2020 // Dr. Sookie Cho_

With this UX design analysis, I'd like to contribute to the vast community of drivers in Los Angeles, whether locals or tourists, with the desire to make driving and parking in LA less stressful, more accessible, and safer for those who dislike this method of experiencing the city, as well as ensure that more people are able to find affordable parking options across the city and visit places they might otherwise not have explored. Although ParkMobile is available throughout the United States in over 350 cities, I am focusing on Los Angeles because of the well-known dislike toward traffic, transportation, and travel within this city — I have lived here for 3 years and do not mind it as much as others, and I believe that ParkMobile has played a role in this. As a result, I’d like to ensure that other drivers in Los Angeles are also able to make use of ParkMobile so that they may have the peace of mind, when traveling through the city, that they can ultimately rely on ParkMobile to help them with their parking needs, and hopefully, make all Angelenos’ driving experiences a bit better.
