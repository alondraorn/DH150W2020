# Lost in Los Angeles: How to Find Parking (and Community) with ParkMobile

### _by Tasia Mochernak // Digital Humanities 150 at UCLA, Winter 2020 // Dr. Sookie Cho_

With this UX design analysis, I'd like to contribute to the vast community of drivers in Los Angeles, whether locals or tourists, with the desire to make driving and parking in LA less stressful, more accessible, and safer for those who dislike this method of experiencing the city, as well as ensure that more people are able to find affordable parking options across the city and visit places they might otherwise not have explored. Although ParkMobile is available throughout the United States in over 350 cities, I am focusing on Los Angeles because of the well-known dislike toward traffic, transportation, and travel within this city — I have lived here for 3 years and do not mind it as much as others, and I believe that ParkMobile has played a role in this. As a result, I’d like to ensure that other drivers in Los Angeles are also able to make use of ParkMobile so that they may have the peace of mind, when traveling through the city, that they can ultimately rely on ParkMobile to help them with their parking needs, and hopefully, make all Angelenos’ driving experiences a bit better.

:white_check_mark: ParkMobile is a “smart mobility” company that provides easy parking solutions for parking providers like college campuses, event venues, stadiums, and airports. Customers can download iOS or Android versions of the ParkMobile application in order to pay for parking from their phones, reserve parking spots ahead of time, or even find areas of the city with more available parking spots. For reference, ParkMobile is the parking system used by UCLA, which I personally began using since the payment machines in the parking garages are often unable to process credit card payments and require exact payment as they do not provide change. 

:white_check_mark: Overall, the ParkMobile mobile application is relatively user-friendly in terms of intuitiveness and practicality of use. In the past, there have been some usability issues and glitches, and the application can be improved upon now as well, but it is clear that the ParkMobile team has been working to make the UX of their application simple and accessible in order to attract and retain users. With 660K reviews in the iOS App Store, ParkMobile has a 4.7 star rating and ranks #6 on the “Navigation” chart, indicating general user satisfaction with the application. I believe that the next step for ParkMobile is to build out some additional capabilities for their ParkMobile Pro premium subscription, as well as make some simplifying UX / UI edits.
