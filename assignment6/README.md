## Overview

**Purpose:** The purpose of creating and testing this low-fidelity prototype is to verify whether or not the features that I have created are helpful for and usable by the target user demographic. 

**User Personas:** The user personas that I have identified can be characterized by the following: people of a legal driving age, own a car, in Los Angeles, likely not tourists, more likely to be current college students or recent grads; they have the desire and ability to drive to places and thus, need a parking solution to assist them; and they do not need any particular level of expertise or tech savviness to use this application. 

**Features & Tasks:** The features and tasks of this low-fi prototype were ideated through various steps of user research, including usability testing of existing ParkMobile features, contextual inquiry of a target user, and other observations made by myself (also a user of ParkMobile) based on my experience and understanding of the driving/parking application space. The three features include: the ability to see how much parking costs at a certain location prior to clicking into that location; receiving recommendations on places to visit in LA; and a ParkMobile integration with Google Maps.

## Wireframes & Wireflows

5 basic wireframes from this prototype are available to download in PDF form [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dgxJxHLlqSpeau1Mgt2NmtKaLJ491fEM/view?usp=sharing).

All wireframes and wireflows can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BiwPBoQVrLznBH7h3skdUHdgDHVBF0VkMs-a9-DKQRk/edit?usp=sharing).

### Notes on Wireflow Test

**Task 1: Seeing the price/hour of parking prior to clicking into parking “zone”**
>I noticed that the user was a bit confused in the beginning when asked (what I thought to be) the most simple task, to choose a parking area based on the price/particular amount of time provided. That led me to believe that maybe it is counterintuitive to provide the user with as much information as possible since that might make it more difficult to quickly make a decision. As seen in the second screen of this task, a more personalized experience might make the experience of the user more efficient. 

**Task 2: Receiving recommendations on places to visit**
>I noticed that the user chose to click on very specific words within the “notifications” like “Learn more…” and “here”. Otherwise, this task seemed to be quite self-explanatory and the user completed all components quite quickly.

**Task 3: Integrating with Google Maps**
>There was some confusion moving between two “interfaces” — the fact that it started at Google Maps (a generally familiar interface for the user) was not made fully clear by me. It was interesting that the user clicked on P for ParkMobile in the design, rather than the price or time frame, which is a good insight for demonstrating that user is attracted to the logo when it is in a different application interface.

The user successfully completed all components of all of the tasks in this low-fidelity prototype test. 

## Summary

Creating the low-fidelity prototype is what it seems most people imagine UX/UI design to be, so it was very interesting to finally reach this phase in the design process. I think the fact that I was simply creating new features for an existing application rather than completely ideating my own application did make this different from what I initially expected at the start of this class. 
I learned that preparing a low-fi prototype by hand is quite a repetitive process — while I was creating the wireframes, I was glad to be building off of the design of an existing application, but I also realized at a certain point that I may have been including too many details in the process. As such, I would definitely like to try my hand at digitizing this process in the future.
Testing the prototype in a paper-and-pencil environment was also quite a unique experience. Conceptually, I understood what needed to happen, but I did not want to guide the user too much with additional arrows or images that were part of the wireflow but not the wireframe. I feel that the user did not pay too much attention to the “click” indications and arrows that I did have present in the wireframes, though, so that part of the testing process went properly. 
Overall, I feel that creating digitized wireframes / wireflows would have allowed me to create and test more scenarios, screens, and steps more easily and may have provided a smoother experience for the test user. However, I feel that the testing that did occur was still beneficial for me because it highlighted the importance of small details for the user in deciding what to choose as their next step.
