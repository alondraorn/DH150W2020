## Overview

**Purpose:** The purpose of creating and testing this low-fidelity prototype is to verify whether or not the features that I have created are helpful for and usable by the target user demographic. 

**User Personas:** The user personas that I have identified can be characterized by the following: people of a legal driving age, own a car, in Los Angeles, likely not tourists, more likely to be current college students or recent grads; they have the desire and ability to drive to places and thus, need a parking solution to assist them; and they do not need any particular level of expertise or tech savviness to use this application. 

**Features & Tasks:** The features and tasks of this low-fi prototype were ideated through various steps of user research, including usability testing of existing ParkMobile features, contextual inquiry of a target user, and other observations made by myself (also a user of ParkMobile) based on my experience and understanding of the driving/parking application space. The three features include: the ability to see how much parking costs at a certain location prior to clicking into that location; receiving recommendations on places to visit in LA; and a ParkMobile integration with Google Maps.
